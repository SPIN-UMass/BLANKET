Networking subsystem:

A "Connection" is a bidirectional communications channel, usually
backed by a network socket. For example, the communication channel
between tor and obfsproxy is a 'connection'. In the code, it's
represented by a Twisted's twisted.internet.protocol.Protocol.

A 'Circuit' is a pair of connections, referred to as the 'upstream'
and 'downstream' connections. The upstream connection of a circuit
communicates in cleartext with the higher-level program that wishes to
make use of our obfuscation service. The downstream connection
communicates in an obfuscated fashion with the remote peer that the
higher-level client wishes to contact. In the code, it's represented
by the custom Circuit class.

The diagram below might help demonstrate the relationship between
connections and circuits:

                                   Downstream

       'Circuit C'      'Connection CD'   'Connection SD'     'Circuit S'
                     +-----------+          +-----------+
     Upstream    +---|Obfsproxy c|----------|Obfsproxy s|----+   Upstream
                 |   +-----------+    ^     +-----------+    |
 'Connection CU' |                    |                      | 'Connection SU'
           +------------+           Sent over       +--------------+
           | Tor Client |           the net         |  Tor Bridge  |
           +------------+                           +--------------+

In the above diagram, "Obfsproxy c" is the client-side obfsproxy, and
"Obfsproxy s" is the server-side obfsproxy. "Connection CU" is the
Client's Upstream connection, the communication channel between tor
and obfsproxy. "Connection CD" is the Client's Downstream connection,
the communication channel between obfsproxy and the remote peer. These
two connections form the client's circuit "Circuit C".

A 'listener' is a listening socket bound to a particular obfuscation
protocol, represented using Twisted's t.i.p.Factory. Connecting to a
listener creates one connection of a circuit, and causes this program
to initiate the other connection (possibly after receiving in-band
instructions about where to connect to). A listener is said to be a
'client' listener if connecting to it creates the upstream connection,
and a 'server' listener if connecting to it creates the downstream
connection.

There are two kinds of client listeners: a 'simple' client listener
always connects to the same remote peer every time it needs to
initiate a downstream connection; a 'socks' client listener can be
told to connect to an arbitrary remote peer using the SOCKS protocol.
