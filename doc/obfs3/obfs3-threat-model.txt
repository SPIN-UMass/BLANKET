              Threat model for the obfs3 obfuscation protocol

The threat model of obfs3 is identical to the threat model of obfs2,
with an added goal:

obfs3 offers protection against passive Deep Packet Inspection
machines that expect the obfs3 protocol. Such machines should not be
able to verify the existence of the obfs3 protocol without launching
an active attack against its handshake.
