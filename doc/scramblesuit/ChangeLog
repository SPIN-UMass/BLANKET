2014-01-19 - Changes in version 2014.01.b:
  - More unit tests and several minor bug fixes.
  - Sanitise shared secret if the user got it slightly wrong.

2014-01-09 - Changes in version 2014.01.a:
  - Update API to be compatible with recent obfsproxy changes.
  - Improve argument parsing.

2013-11-18 - Changes in version 2013.11.a:
  - Revert UniformDH group size back to 1536 bits to have less of a timing
    distinguisher at the cost of having less effective security.  Note that
    this also breaks compatibility with version 2013.10.a!
  - Add the config option "USE_IAT_OBFUSCATION" which can be used to disable
    inter-arrival time obfuscation.  This would mean more throughput at the
    cost of being slightly more detectable.
  - Add a fast FIFO buffer implementation.
  - Refactored plenty of code.
  - Add this ChangeLog file.

2013-10-02 - Changes in version 2013.10.a:
  - First public release of ScrambleSuit.
