Just run: # python setup.py install

You will need to run the above command as root. It will install
obfsproxy somewhere in your $PATH. If you don't want that, you can
try to run
$ python setup.py install -user
as your regular user, and setup.py will install obfsproxy somewhere
in your home directory
